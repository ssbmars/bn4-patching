## place ROMs in `/rom/`
File names matter.  
bn4bm.gba  
bn4rs.gba  
By default, this repo is set up to only modify bn4bm.gba (BN4 Blue Moon, US version)  
To modify an additional rom, new parameters for it must be included in `compile.bat` and `compile.tpl`. If you are making changes with assembly files then the new rom will need to have proper addresses defined for it (asm/xyz_addr.asm).  

## finding the text archives to edit
There are full text archive dumps of BlueMoon and RedSun in `/textdumps/`. Search through it for what you want and copy the text to `bm_text.tpl` before editing. Some common text archives have already been copied over.  
An intact text archive looks like this:  
``` 
@archive 00A455
@size 10

script 0 mmbn4s {
	"Bingus"
	end
}
script 1 mmbn4s {
	"Binted"
	end
}
```
When copying a text archive, not all scripts need to be included. Any script that gets excluded will simply remain unmodified. Scripts can also look like this. Note the difference in the name directly following the script number (mmbn4 vs mmbn4s):  
```
@archive 74C670
@size 256

script 5 mmbn4 {
	msgOpenQuick
	textSpeed
		delay = 0
	"""
	Snowstorm
	attack!
	Ice Panel
	"""
	keyWait
		any = true
	end
	msgCloseQuick
}
```

## editing it

The important text archive where your text changes go is located in the root of this repo.  
`bm_text.tpl` is for BN4 Blue Moon. This is a textpet file, thank you Prof.9  

To modify assembly, or do any sort of procedural hex editing, look inside the `/asm/` folder for assembly files such as `bn4.asm`. Put your modifications in that file.  
The `_addr` files such as `bn4bm_addr.asm` and `bn4rs_addr.asm` are to define addresses in the ROM that are different between the two versions of the game, allowing you to modify addresses defined by a variable that gets set depending on which rom is being edited. If you are only modifying one version, you can ignore this file and nothing bad will happen.  
Assembly edits are carried out by armips, which has some fantastic documentation.

## shipping it

run `compile.bat` to apply the changes. ROMs get generated in the `/out/` folder along with a BPS patch that can apply over a vanilla ROM.  
In the same folder you will also see `release.py`. This python file is nifty and will generate patch metadata for Tango. Open `release.py` in a text editor and follow the instructions in the comments to set up your patch metadata for release.  
Running the python script requires the python runtime (very easy to install).

You could ignore the python script and put the metadata together yourself, but like, c'mon.
